# Python-Project
Crime Data Exploratory Data Analysis (2020 - Present)
This project is a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) on crime data ranging from 2020 to the present. The dataset contains thousands of criminal incident records, including details about the type of crime, date and time, location, victim information, and weapon usage. The goal of this project is to identify key trends, detect anomalies, and draw actionable insights using Python.

Project Overview
The analysis begins with data cleaning and preparation using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Missing values are handled with care to ensure data quality. After cleaning, the data is transformed into meaningful formats to enable effective visualization and exploration.

Custom visualizations are built using Matplotlib and Seaborn to study:

Yearly and monthly crime patterns

Most common crime types and their frequency

Victim demographics (age, gender, descent)

Weapon usage trends and correlations

Geographic distribution of crimes

Status of reported crimes (solved/unsolved)

Additionally, statistical methods such as correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and probability distributions are applied to support the insights with data-backed evidence.

The project is structured to be beginner-friendly and interactive, making it easy to understand even for someone new to data analysis. All warnings have been addressed to ensure a smooth and clean experience.
